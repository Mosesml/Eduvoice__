          <p>
            EduVoice is a groundbreaking project designed to revolutionize
            education for deaf students by utilizing cutting-edge technology. By
            integrating OLLAMA 3 for our chatbot and the WebkitSpeechRecognition
            API for real-time speech-to-text transcription, we provide a
            comprehensive solution to the communication barriers faced by these
            students. Our software, developed using CSS, HTML, Python, Flask,
            and JavaScript within the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) environment,
            delivers accurate transcriptions and immediate support through a
            user-friendly interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            EduVoice was created to address the significant challenges that deaf
            students encounter, such as the need to switch between interpreters
            and note-taking, which increases cognitive load and fatigue. By
            promoting greater independence and real-time engagement with
            educational material, our tool aims to foster inclusivity and
            improve learning outcomes. This website serves as the central hub
            for information about EduVoice, offering insights into our project's
            goals, technological framework, and ongoing developments in
            enhancing educational accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, we have created two new features, one being the pomodoro
            timer, the other, a PDF to Notes creator. The Pomodoro timer,
            created with HTML, CSS, and JS, allows the user to work in 25 minute
            study intervals with 5 minute breaks. However, a difference between
            the one on EduVoice and traditional pomodoro timers is that ours
            sends a notification to the user's MAC or PC, allowing individuals
            with' hearing problems to get visual aid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with the Pomodoro timer, we have introduced the PDF to notes
            feature. This Features frontend is developed through HTML CSS and JS
            as well. The backend is connected through AJAX, It takes in the text
            inputted through the PDF and runs it through an open source library
            called PyMuPDF, a library made to extract text from PDFs. Then, it
            uses the spaCy NLP library which is then sent to sumy, where it
            summarizes the text and extracts key words.
